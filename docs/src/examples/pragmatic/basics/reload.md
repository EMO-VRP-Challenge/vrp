# Multiple trips

These examples demonstrates how to use vehicle reload feature which is designed to overcome vehicle capacity limitation
in order to perform multiple trips (tours).

Essentially, reload is a place where vehicle can unload `static` pickups and load new `static` deliveries. Here, static
correspond to `static demand` concept which is defined via standalone pickup or delivery jobs, not by single pickup and
delivery job.

## Same location reload

In this scenario, once some jobs are delivered, the vehicle returns to the original depot to load next goods.

## Multiple reloads with different locations

In this scenario, vehicle picks goods and flushes them on two different locations during single tour. This can be used
to model _waste collection_ use case.
